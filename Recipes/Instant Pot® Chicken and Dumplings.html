    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <P>I wanted the richness of long-simmered chicken stew, but without the fuss of using a whole chicken. This compromise, using boneless skinless chicken thighs with bone-in chicken breast, gave me the richness of flavor and ease of preparation I was looking for! It's basically chicken pot pie made in a pressure cooker rather than an oven.</P>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup diced carrot</li>
        <li>½ cup diced celery</li>
        <li>1 pound bone-in chicken breasts, skin removed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Step 1</h3> Pour the olive oil into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot®) and select the Saute function. Cook onion, carrot, celery, and bay leaf until the vegetables are soft and the onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <li>Add chicken broth, chicken thighs, chicken breasts, thyme, marjoram, salt, and pepper. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 9 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
    </ul>
